# Route Planning

You use this skill to generate the physical path of the marathon.

## Geographic Context (Built-in Data)
You have access to a road network GeoJSON located at `assets/network.json`.
Key features available in this network include:
- **Landmarks**: Point features with `properties.name` (e.g., Mandalay Bay,
  Bellagio, Sphere, Las Vegas Sign, Allegiant Stadium, The Venetian,
  Michelob Ultra Arena, etc.).
  These landmarks are used automatically by `plan_marathon_route()` to build the route.
- **Named Roads**: All 34 LineString features have `properties.name` (e.g.,
  Las Vegas Boulevard, Las Vegas Freeway, Sahara Avenue, Flamingo Road,
  Rainbow Boulevard, Paradise Road, Sunset Road, Tropicana Avenue,
  Desert Inn Road, Eastern Avenue, Maryland Parkway, etc.).

## Algorithm

The default algorithm is **zone-sweep**: the route starts near a landmark,
sweeps through city zones (neighborhoods) using non-crossing geometry, and
finishes southbound on the Strip at the Las Vegas Sign. The algorithm handles
all route geometry automatically — you do not need to select petals or
manually sequence landmarks.

The legacy **cloverleaf/petal** algorithm is still available via the
`petal_names` parameter if explicitly requested.

## Instructions

1. **Just call it**: `plan_marathon_route()` with no arguments produces a valid
   26.2-mile zone-sweep route. Use `start_landmark` and `seed` for variety.
2. **Precision**: The tool uses interpolation to guarantee exactly 26.2 miles.
3. **GeoJSON**: Input must be valid road network GeoJSON.

## Tools

- `plan_marathon_route(algorithm: str = "zone_sweep", start_landmark: Optional[str] = None, seed: Optional[int] = None, petal_names: Optional[list[str]] = None, geojson_data: Optional[str] = None)`:
  Generate the exact 26.2-mile path.
  - `algorithm`: `"zone_sweep"` (default) or `"cloverleaf"`.
  - `start_landmark`: Name of a landmark to start near (e.g., `"Michelob Ultra Arena"`). Zone-sweep only.
  - `seed`: Integer seed for route variety. Different seeds produce different routes. Zone-sweep only.
  - `petal_names`: List of petal names. Cloverleaf algorithm only.
- `add_water_stations(route_geojson: dict)`: Append water station features.
- `add_medical_tents(route_geojson: dict)`: Append medical tent features.
- `report_marathon_route(route_geojson: dict)`: Emit the final GeoJSON to the system registry.

### Decision-Making Guidance
- For most requests, call `plan_marathon_route()` with default arguments.
- Use `seed` to generate alternative routes when the user wants variety.
- Use `start_landmark` when the user specifies a preferred starting area.
- Only use `petal_names` if the user explicitly asks for the cloverleaf/petal approach.
